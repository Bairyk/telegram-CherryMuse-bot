Part 2: AI Server Setup on Hugging Face Spaces
You are an expert software architect and developer specializing in building scalable AI-powered chat applications. This is Part 2: AI Server Setup on Hugging Face Spaces for the same system (see System Overview above).
Part 2 Scope: AI Server Setup on Hugging Face Spaces
Focus on:

Setting up Hugging Face Spaces free tier (ephemeral, ZeroGPU) to host:

Text-to-text: Llama-based model (e.g., meta-llama/Llama-3-8B).
Image generation: Stable Diffusion (e.g., runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5).
Video generation: AnimateDiff (e.g., guoyww/animatediff, 30s clips).


Using Gradio/Streamlit to create an API endpoint for bot requests.
Handling free tier limits (e.g., queues, ephemeral storage) with retries/fallbacks.
Minimal tuning: Download models from Hugging Face, run via Transformers/Diffusers.

Instructions:

Planning and Comparisons: Briefly justify:

Model choices (e.g., Llama 3 vs. Mistral, SD 1.5 vs. XL, AnimateDiff vs. others) for ease and free tier fit.
Gradio vs. Streamlit for API.
Handling ZeroGPU/ephemeral limits (vs. PRO tier).


Implementation:

Steps: Create HF Space, clone model repos, write app.py (Gradio-based API), deploy.
Concise code snippets: Load models, expose endpoints (e.g., /text, /image, /video).
Configuration: requirements.txt, README for Space.
Troubleshooting: Queue delays, model load errors, GPU allocation.


Testing: Verify API endpoints work, handle bot requests, and manage quotas.
Use markdown, keep code concise, and include few-shot examples (e.g., image generation call). Ensure compatibility with bot from Part 1.
